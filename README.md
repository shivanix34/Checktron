# Checktron
Hello Guys , This is Checkers/Draughts AI agent that plays against humans!!
## Overview
This project focuses on developing a sophisticated
AI opponent capable of engaging in 1vs1 battles with human
players. Leveraging the Minimax algorithm, tailored to the zerosum dynamics of draughts, our AI agent strategically evaluates
potential moves while anticipating human responses. To enhance
efficiency, we integrate α-β pruning techniques, allowing the
agent to focus on the most promising paths by eliminating
irrelevant branches of the game tree. Moreover, we refine and
optimize evaluation functions to provide nuanced assessments of
game states, facilitating adaptive gameplay. Through iterative
refinement, our project aims to push the boundaries of AI
performance in strategic decision-making, showcasing the potential of computational intelligence in mastering complex board
games. ”Draughts Dynamics” contributes to the discourse on AI’s
capabilities in adversarial environments, demonstrating its role
in strategic gaming and computational intelligence research.

## Evaluation
The Minimax Algorithm with α-β Pruning:


• The Minimax algorithm is a fundamental technique
in game theory for decision-making in adversarial
environments. It aims to determine the best move
for a player by exploring the game tree to a certain
depth.


• The core idea behind Minimax is to maximize the
minimum possible outcome for the player, assuming
that the opponent plays optimally.


• It works recursively, evaluating all possible moves
up to a certain depth and assigning scores to each
move based on the expected outcome of the game.


• α-β pruning is an optimization technique that reduces the number of nodes evaluated by the Minimax algorithm by eliminating branches that are
guaranteed to be worse than previously examined
branches.


• By maintaining two values, α (the minimum score
that the maximizing player is assured of) and β
(the maximum score that the minimizing player is
assured of), α-β pruning can prune branches that
fall outside this range.


• The efficiency of α-β pruning lies in its ability to
eliminate portions of the game tree that cannot influence the final decision, thus significantly reducing
the computational overhead.
